    "# Big Arrays, Fast: Profiling Cloud Storage Read Throughput\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many geoscience problems involve analyzing hundreds of Gigabytes (GB), many Terabytes (TB = 100 GB), or even a Petabyte (PB = 1000 TB) of data.\n",
    "For such data volumes, downloading data to personal computers is inefficient.\n",
    "Data-proximate computing, possibly using a parallel computing cluster, is one way to overcome this challenge.\n",
    "With data-proximate computing, a user access a remote computer which is connected tightly to shared, high-performance storage, enabling rapid processing without the need for a download step.\n",

    "\n",
    "The cloud offers many exciting new possibilities for scientific data analysis.\n",
    "It also brings new technical challenges.\n",
    "Many scientific users are accustomed to the environments found on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, such as NSF's XSEDE Computers or NCAR's Cheyenne system.\n",
    "These systems combine parallel computing with a high-performance shared filesystem, enabling massively parallel data analytics.\n",
    "When shifting workloads to the cloud, one of the biggest challenges is how to store data: _cloud computing does not easily support large shared filesystems, as commonly found on HPC systems_.\n",
    "The preferred way to store data in the cloud is using _cloud object storage_, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cloud object storage is essentially a key/value storage system.\n",
    "They keys are strings, and the values are bytes of data.\n",
    "Data is read and written using HTTP calls.\n",
    "The performance of object storage is very different from file storage.\n",
    "On one hand, each individual read / write to object storage has a high overhead (10-100 ms), since it has to go over the network.\n",
    "On the other hand, object storage \"scales out\" nearly infinitely, meaning that we can make hundreds, thousands, or millions of concurrent reads / writes.\n",
    "This makes object storage well suited for distributed data analytics.\n",
    "However, the software architecture of a data analysis system must be adapted to take advantage of these properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate one software stack that can effectively exploit the scalable nature of cloud storage and computing for data processing. There are three key elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Zarr](http://zarr.readthedocs.io/) - a library for the storage of multi-dimensional arrays using compressed chunks.\n",
    "- [Filesystem Spec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/) - an abstraction layer for working with different storage technologies. Specific implementations of filesystem spec (e.g. [gcsfs](https://gcsfs.readthedocs.io/), Google Cloud Storage Filesystem) allow Zarr to read and write data from object storage.\n",
    "- [Dask](http://dask.pydata.org/) - a distributed computing framework that allows us to read and write data in parallel asynchronously.\n"

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above shows a wide range of throughput rates and scaling behavior.\n",
    "There are a great many factors which might influence the results, including:\n",
    "- The structure of the source data (e.g. data format, chunk size, compression, etc.)\n",
    "- The rate at which the storage service can read and process data from its own disks\n",
    "- The transport protocol and encoding (compression, etc.)\n",
    "- The network bandwidth between the source and Google Cloud US-CENTRAL1 region\n",
    "- The overhead of the dask cluster in computing many tasks simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison is far from \"fair\": it is clearly biased towards Google Cloud Storage, which has optimum network proximity to the compute location. Nevertheless, we make the following observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zarr is about 10x faster than NetCDF in Cloud Object Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Using 40 cores (20 dask workers), we were able to pull netCDF data from Google Cloud Storage at a rate of about 500 MB/s.\n",
    "Using the Zarr format, we could get to 5000 MB/s (5 GB/s) for the same number of dask workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Cloud Storage Scales\n",
    "\n",
    "Both formats, however, showed good scaling, with throughput increasingly nearly linearly with the size of the cluster.\n",
    "The largest experiment we attempted used nearly 400 cores: we were able to pull data from GCS at roughly 20 GB/s.\n",
    "That's pretty fast! At this rate, we could process a Petebyte of data in about 14 hours.\n",
    "However, there is a knee in the GCS-Zarr curve around 150 cores, with the scaling becoming slightly poorer above that value.\n",
    "We hypothesize that this is due to Dask's overhead from handling a very large task graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### External Cloud Storage Providers Scale...then Saturate\n",
    "\n",
    "We tested three cloud storage providers _outside_ of Google Cloud: Wasabi (a commercial service), Jetstream (an NSF-operated cloud), and OSN (an NSF-sponsored storage provider).\n",
    "These curves all show a similar pattern: good scaling for low worker counts, then a plateau.\n",
    "We interpret this a saturation of the network bandwidth between the data and the compute location.\n",
    "Of these three, Jetstream saturated at the lowest value (2 GB/s), then Wasabi (3.5 GB/s, but possibly not fully saturated yet), then OSN (5.5 GB/s).\n",
    "Also noteworthy is the fact that, for smaller core counts, OSN was actually _faster_ than GCS _within Google Cloud_.\n",
    "These results are likely highly sensitive to network topology.\n",
    "However, they show unambiguously that OSN is an attractive choice for cloud-style storage and on-demand big-data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OPeNDAP is Slow\n",
    "\n",
    "The fastest we could get data out of an OPeNDAP server was 100 MB/s (UCAR ESGF Node).\n",
    "The NOAA ESRL server was more like 20 MB/s.\n",
    "These rates are many orders of magnitude than cloud storage.\n",
    "Perhaps these servers have throttling in place to limit their total bandwidth.\n",
    "Or perhaps the OPeNDAP protocol itself has some fundamental inefficiencies.\n",
    "OPeNDAP remains a very convenient protocol for remote data access; if we wish to use it for Big Data and distributed processing, data providers need to find some way to speed it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrated a protocol for testing the throughput and scalability Array data storage with the Dask computing framework.\n",
    "Using Google Cloud as our compute platform, we found, unsurprisingly, that a cloud-optimized storage format (Zarr), used with in-region cloud storage, provided the best raw throughput (up to 20 GB/s in our test) and scalability.\n",
    "We found that the same storage format also allowed us to transfer data on-demand from other clouds at reasonable rates (5 GB/s) for modest levels of parallelism.\n",
    "(Care must be taken in this case, however, because many cloud providers charge egress fees for data leaving their network.)\n",
    "Combined with Zarr, all of the cloud object storage platforms were able to deliver data orders of magnitude faster than traditional OPeNDAP servers, the standard remote-data-access protocol for the geosciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis could be improved in numerous ways. In the future we would like to\n",
    "- Investigate other cloud-native storage formats, such as TileDB and Cloud-Optimized Geotiff\n",
    "- Perform deeper analysis of parameter sensitivity (chunk size, compression, etc.)\n",
    "- Explore other clouds (e.g. AWS, Microstoft Azure)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we did not attempt to assess the relative costs associated with cloud vs. on-premises data storage, as this involves difficult questions related to total cost of ownership.\n",
    "However, we hope these results are useful for data providers in deciding how to provision future infrastructure for data-intensive geoscience."
